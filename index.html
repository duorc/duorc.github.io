            <p>DuoRC contains 186,089 unique question-answer pairs created from a collection of 7680 pairs of movie plots where
                each pair in the collection reflects two versions of the same movie.</p>
            <h4>Why another RC dataset?</h4>
            <p>DuoRC pushes the NLP community to address challenges on incorporating knowledge and reasoning in neural architectures
                for reading comprehension. It poses several interesting challenges such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>DuoRC using parallel plots is especially designed to contain a large number of questions with
                    <b>low lexical overlap
                    </b> between questions and their corresponding passages</li>
                <li>It requires models to go beyond the content of the given passage itself and incorporate world-knowledge,
                    background knowledge, and common-sense knowledge to arrive at the answer</li>
                <li>It revolves around narrative passages from movie plots describing complex events and therefore naturally
                    require complex reasoning (e.g. temporal reasoning, entailment, long-distance anaphoras, etc.) across
                    multiple sentences to infer the answer to questions</li>
                <li>Several of the questions in DuoRC, while seeming relevant, cannot actually be answered from the given passage.
                    This requires the model to detect the
                    <b>unanswerability</b> of questions. This aspect is important for machines to achieve in industrial settings
                    in particular</li>
